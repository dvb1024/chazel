## Creating a Cluster

```clojure
user=> (require '[chazel.core :refer :all])
nil
```

let's start a 3 node cluster

```clojure
user=> (cluster-of 3)
Mar 26, 2015 1:46:43 PM com.hazelcast.cluster.ClusterService
INFO: [10.36.124.50]:5701 [dev] [3.4.1]

Members [3] {
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5701 this
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5702
    Member [10.36.124.50]:5703
}
(#<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_1_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5701}> #<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_2_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5702}> #<HazelcastInstanceProxy HazelcastInstance{name='_hzInstance_3_dev', node=Address[10.36.124.50]:5703}>)
```

## Working with Data Structures

create a map (or multimap, or queue, etc):

```clojure
user=> (def appl (hz-map :appl))
#'user/appl

user=> (type appl)
com.hazelcast.map.impl.proxy.MapProxyImpl
```

use the map:

```clojure
user=> (put! appl :apple 42)

user=> appl
{:apple 42}
```

some other cool things:

```clojure
user=> (def goog (hz-map :goog))
#'user/goog

user=> (put! goog :goog 42)

user=> (find-all-maps)
({:appl 42} 
 {:goog 42})
```

## Connecting as a Client

```clojure
user=> (def c (client-instance {:group-password "dev-pass", 
                                :hosts ["127.0.0.1"], 
                                :retry-ms 5000, 
                                :retry-max 720000, 
                                :group-name "dev"}))
                                
INFO: connecting to:  {:group-password dev-pass, :hosts [127.0.0.1], :retry-ms 5000, :retry-max 720000, :group-name dev}

user=> c
#<HazelcastClientProxy com.hazelcast.client.impl.HazelcastClientInstanceImpl@42b215c8>
```

In case it could not connect, it would retry according to `:retry-ms` and `:retry-max` values:

```clojure
WARNING: Unable to get alive cluster connection, try in 5000 ms later, attempt 1 of 720000.
WARNING: Unable to get alive cluster connection, try in 5000 ms later, attempt 2 of 720000.
...
```

## Stats

This is a constant area of improvement and at the moment there are 2 ways to get some stats:

### Maps and Sizes

First is a simplistic way to find all the maps accross the cluster with their sizes (i.e. total number of values across all nodes):

```clojure
chazel=> (def appl (hz-map "appl"))
#'chazel/appl
chazel=> (def goog (hz-map "goog"))
#'chazel/goog

chazel=> (map-sizes)
{"goog" {:size 0}, "appl" {:size 0}}

now let's add some values and run `(map-sizes)` again:

chazel=> (doseq [n (range 2048)] (put! goog n (str n)))
chazel=> (doseq [n (range 1024)] (put! appl n (str n)))

chazel=> (map-sizes)
{"goog" {:size 2048}, "appl" {:size 1024}}
```

not too much intel, but proves to be quite useful: you see all the existing maps (IMap distributed objects) as well as their sizes.

### Cluster Stats

In case you need to get _all_ stats across the cluster, there are options:

* [Management Center](https://hazelcast.com/products/management-center/) that comes with hazelcast, but _you pay_ for clusters over 2 nodes
* [hface](https://github.com/tolitius/hface) will give you all the stats with GUI, free for any number of nodes, but not as powerful as the management center
* built in chazel `(cluster-stats)` function, but you'll have to include an [8KB dependency](https://clojars.org/org.hface/hface-client) to your cluster nodes
which is just a callable that is able to collect node stats

Here is an example of a built in `(cluster-stats)`:

```clojure

chazel=> (cluster-stats)

{"Member [192.168.1.185]:5701 this"
 {:master true,
  :clusterName "dev",
  :instanceNames ["c:goog" "c:appl" "e:stats-exec-service"],
  :memberList
  ["192.168.1.185:5701" "192.168.2.185:5702" "192.168.2.185:5703"],
  :memberState
  {:runtimeProps
   {:osMemory.freePhysicalMemory 2046976000,
    :runtime.loadedClassCount 10130,
    ;;...
    }}
   :executorStats {:stats-exec-service {:creationTime 1462910619108, :pending 0, :started 4, :completed 3, :cancelled 0, :totalStartLatency 0, :totalExecutionTime 49}},
   :multiMapStats {},
   :topicStats {},
   :memoryStats {:committedNativeMemory 0, :creationTime 0, :usedNativeMemory 0, :freePhysical 2046976000, :maxNativeMemory 0, :freeNativeMemory 0, :maxHeap 3817865216, :totalPhysical 17179869184, :usedHeap 985153872, :gcStats {:creationTime 0, :minorCount 17, :minorTime 198, :majorCount 2, :majorTime 314, :unknownCount 0, :unknownTime 0}, :committedHeap 1548746752},
   :mapStats
   {:goog
    {:creationTime 1462910602378, :maxGetLatency 0, :maxPutLatency 2, :lastAccessTime 0, :maxRemoveLatency 0, :heapCost 238277, :totalGetLatencies 0, :numberOfOtherOperations 90, :ownedEntryMemoryCost 118788, :getCount 0, :hits 0, :backupCount 1, :totalRemoveLatencies 0, :backupEntryMemoryCost 119489, :removeCount 0, :totalPutLatencies 316, :dirtyEntryCount 0, :lastUpdateTime 1462910608301, :backupEntryCount 681, :lockedEntryCount 0, :ownedEntryCount 677, :putCount 2048, :numberOfEvents 0},
    :appl
    {:creationTime 1462910599320, :maxGetLatency 0, :maxPutLatency 68, :lastAccessTime 0, :maxRemoveLatency 0, :heapCost 119125, :totalGetLatencies 0, :numberOfOtherOperations 90, :ownedEntryMemoryCost 60004, :getCount 0, :hits 0, :backupCount 1, :totalRemoveLatencies 0, :backupEntryMemoryCost 59121, :removeCount 0, :totalPutLatencies 390, :dirtyEntryCount 0, :lastUpdateTime 1462910604627, :backupEntryCount 338, :lockedEntryCount 0, :ownedEntryCount 343, :putCount 1024, :numberOfEvents 0}},
   :replicatedMapStats {},
   :queueStats {},
   ;; lots and lots more for this member..
 }

 "Member [192.168.2.185]:5703"
 {:master false,
  :clusterName "dev",
  :instanceNames ["c:goog" "c:appl" "e:stats-exec-service"],
  ;; lots and lots more for this member..
 }

 "Member [192.168.2.185]:5702"
 {:master false,
  :clusterName "dev",
  :instanceNames ["c:goog" "c:appl" "e:stats-exec-service"],
   ;; lots and lots more for this member..
 }
```

`(cluster-stats)` returns a `{member stats}` map with ALL the stats available for the cluster.

again in order to make it work, add a little [8KB dependency](https://clojars.org/org.hface/hface-client) to your cluster nodes, so it can collect stats
from each node / member.

## Distributed SQL Queries

Hazelcast has a concept of [Distributed Query](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.5/manual/html/distributedquery.html) with quite rich [SQL syntax supported](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.5/manual/html/querysql.html).

chazel embraces it into a single function `select`. Let's look at the example that is taught at Jedi Order.

### Jedi Order

Since Hazelcast internally works with Java objects, it relies on getter/setter accessors for its full SQL power. This is not that bad as it might seem at the first glance. Think Google Protobufs, or many other Java serialization protocols, the all produce objects with getters and setters.

Let's call for the Jedi Masters:

```clojure
chazel=> (require '[chazel.core :refer :all])
chazel=> (import '[chazel.jedis Jedi])

chazel=> (def masters {1 (Jedi. "Yoda" "vim")
                       2 (Jedi. "Mace Windu" "emacs")
                       3 (Jedi. "Qui-Gon Jinn" "cursive")
                       4 (Jedi. "Obi-Wan Kenobi" "vim")
                       5 (Jedi. "Luke Skywalker" "vim")
                       6 (Jedi. "Mara Jade Skywalker" "emacs")
                       7 (Jedi. "Leia Organa Solo" "emacs")
                       8 (Jedi. "Jaina Solo Fel" "atom")})
```

[Jedi](test/chazel/jedis.clj#L5) is an example type that has `name` and `editor` fields. 

You guessed it right, we are going to rely on SQL query powers to finally find out which editors Jedis Masters use!

### Jedi SQL

Now as we called upon the masters, let's put them into a Hazelcast map. We can use a `put-all!` for that:

```clojure
chazel=> (def jedis (hz-map "jedis"))
#'chazel/jedis

chazel=> (put-all! jedis masters)
```

Let's now run some _distributed_ SQL on the new Jedi Master database:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim")

#{#<Jedi {:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}> 
  #<Jedi {:name Yoda :editor vim}> 
  #<Jedi {:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}>}
```

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "name like %Sky%")

#{#<Jedi {:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}> 
  #<Jedi {:name Mara Jade Skywalker :editor emacs}>}
```

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "name like %Sky% and editor != emacs")

#{#<Jedi {:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}>}
```

niice!

In case a database / map is large, we can add [field indices](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.5/manual/html/queryindexing.html)

```clojure
chazel=> (add-index jedis "editor")
```

now this query will run _waaay_ faster:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim")

#{#<Jedi {:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}> 
  #<Jedi {:name Yoda :editor vim}> 
  #<Jedi {:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}>}
```

for larger datasets.

#### Query Results Format

By default a distributed query will return a set:

```clojure
chazel=> (type (select jedis "editor = vim"))
clojure.lang.PersistentHashSet
```

In case you need an actual submap: i.e. all the matching map entries (k,v pairs), just ask:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim" :as :map)

{1 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x44bb1c0a "{:name Yoda :editor vim}"],
 4 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x4ad0c3c5 "{:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"],
 5 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x2725fbd0 "{:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"]}
```

```clojure
chazel=> (type (select jedis "editor = vim" :as :map))
clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
```

For a better interop, you can also ask for a Hazelcast "native" type:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim" :as :native)

#{#object[java.util.AbstractMap$SimpleImmutableEntry 0x69cfa867 "1={:name Yoda :editor vim}"]
  #object[java.util.AbstractMap$SimpleImmutableEntry 0x3b0a56f9 "4={:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"]
  #object[java.util.AbstractMap$SimpleImmutableEntry 0x3b498787 "5={:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"]}
```

```clojure
chazel=> (type (select jedis "editor = vim" :as :native))
com.hazelcast.map.impl.query.QueryResultCollection
```

In case a wrong / unknown format is asked for, chazel will tell you so:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim" :as :foo)

ERROR: can't return a result of a distributed query as ":foo" (an unknown format you provided). query: "editor = vim", running on: "jedis"
```

### Pagination, ORDER BY, LIMIT

SQL would not be too useful if we could not do things like "I only need first 100 results out of millions you have" or "sort the results by the revenue". In more SQL like speak, these two would be: `LIMIT 100` and `ORDER BY "revenue"`.

Hazelcast supports both through [Paging Predicates](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.7/manual/html-single/index.html#filtering-with-paging-predicates):

> _Hazelcast provides paging for defined predicates. With its PagingPredicate class, you can get a collection of keys, values, or entries page by page by filtering them with predicates and giving the size of the pages. Also, you can sort the entries by specifying comparators._

Think about it as `LIMIT` and `ORDER BY` with pagination built in: i.e. once you get a resultset back you can navigate it by pages. Pretty neat :)

With chazel it's just a couple of optional keys to the `select` function.

#### Paging Jedis

Using [Jedis Masters](#jedi-order) example from above:

```clojure
chazel=> jedis

{6 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x7eb421d4 "{:name Mara Jade Skywalker :editor emacs}"],
 1 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x39208ed7 "{:name Yoda :editor vim}"],
 4 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x4f001c4f "{:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"],
 5 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x417eede1 "{:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"],
 2 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x1e9bde9b "{:name Mace Windu :editor emacs}"],
 8 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x2370bda9 "{:name Jaina Solo Fel :editor atom}"],
 3 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x6cdd2fec "{:name Qui-Gon Jinn :editor cursive}"],
 7 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x5a7ac673 "{:name Leia Organa Solo :editor emacs}"]}
```

Let's bring them ALL (i.e. `*`) back to the client side in pages of `3`:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "*" :page-size 3)
{:pages #object[chazel.Pages 0x58406675 "chazel.Pages@58406675"],
 :results
 #{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x170a94e7 "{:name Jaina Solo Fel :editor atom}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x2b4d73f4 "{:name Leia Organa Solo :editor emacs}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x6f1e19da "{:name Mara Jade Skywalker :editor emacs}"]}}
```

notice the `chazel.Pages` under the `:pages` key that is returned, let's use it to get the next page, and then the next page, and then the next:

```clojure
chazel=> (def paging-jedis (select jedis "*" :page-size 3))
#'chazel/paging-jedis

chazel=> (-> paging-jedis :pages next-page)
#{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x7122e00f "{:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"]
  #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x599d002f "{:name Qui-Gon Jinn :editor cursive}"]
  #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x5c4e9eda "{:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"]}

chazel=> (-> paging-jedis :pages next-page)
#{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x7eabb220 "{:name Yoda :editor vim}"]
  #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x422d73b3 "{:name Mace Windu :editor emacs}"]}

chazel=> (-> paging-jedis :pages next-page)
#{}
```

niice!

Of course we can also _filter page results_ with Hazelcast SQL (i.e. `"editor = vim"`):

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "editor = vim" :page-size 2)
{:pages #object[chazel.Pages 0x140ff895 "chazel.Pages@140ff895"],
 :results
 #{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x77b276a3 "{:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x562345a4 "{:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"]}}
```

Yoda here did not make to the first page, but it is comfortably watching Luke and Obi-Wan from the second / last page with Jedis who use `vim`:

```clojure
chazel=> (-> (select jedis "editor = vim" :page-size 2) :pages next-page)
#{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x59e58d76 "{:name Yoda :editor vim}"]}
```

#### Jedi Order (By)

A simple [Java Comparator](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html) can be used to sort paginated results. While you can create it with a [comparator](https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/comparator) functoin, in most cases (as it works 99% in Clojure) a simple function will do.

First, since in this example Jedis are Java Beans and the Hazelcast SQL resultset is a collection of [SimpleImmutableEntry](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractMap.SimpleImmutableEntry.html)s let's create an `editor` field accessor:

```clojure
(defn jedit [m]
  (let [jedi (.getValue m)]
    (.getEditor jedi)))
```

which just wraps a couple of Java calls to get the value of the map entry and get the editor form the Jedi.

Now let's create a "comparator" function:

```clojure
(defn by-editor [a b]
  (compare (jedit a) (jedit b)))
```

which compares Jedis by the editor they use.

Let's get those pages sorted with this comparator providing it to a `:order-by` optional param of `select`:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "*" :page-size 4 :order-by by-editor)
{:pages #object[chazel.Pages 0x544d44f3 "chazel.Pages@544d44f3"],
 :results
 #{#object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x57367fa1 "{:name Qui-Gon Jinn :editor cursive}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x1f14b62c "{:name Mara Jade Skywalker :editor emacs}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x3b6118af "{:name Mace Windu :editor emacs}"]
   #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x57999413 "{:name Jaina Solo Fel :editor atom}"]}}
```

Hm.. did not seem to work.

Ah, remember from [Query Results Format](#query-results-format), the default resultset is a `set`, hence the order is lost. Let's try to change a format to, say, a `:map`:

```clojure
chazel=> (select jedis "*" :page-size 4 :order-by by-editor :as :map)
{:pages #object[chazel.Pages 0x4e42e6e2 "chazel.Pages@4e42e6e2"],
 :results
 {8 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x2cc64579 "{:name Jaina Solo Fel :editor atom}"],
  3 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x27400d5f "{:name Qui-Gon Jinn :editor cursive}"],
  2 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x6908aeee "{:name Mace Windu :editor emacs}"],
  6 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x56899da8 "{:name Mara Jade Skywalker :editor emacs}"]}}
```

now it's sorted, so as the page right after it:

```clojure
chazel=> (def pages (-> (select jedis "*" :page-size 4 :order-by by-editor :as :map) :pages))
#'chazel/pages

chazel=> (next-page pages)
{7 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x6aa98c05 "{:name Leia Organa Solo :editor emacs}"],
 1 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x5d4a1841 "{:name Yoda :editor vim}"],
 4 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x63cd1e72 "{:name Obi-Wan Kenobi :editor vim}"],
 5 #object[chazel.jedis.Jedi 0x2838423b "{:name Luke Skywalker :editor vim}"]}
```

Luke Skywalker comes last in this chapter, but no worries, this is just the beginning...

## Distributed Tasks

Sending work to be done remotely on the cluster is very useful, and Hazelcast has a [rich set of APIs](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.5/javadoc/com/hazelcast/core/IExecutorService.html) to do that.

chazel does not implement all the APIs, but it does provide a simple way of sending tasks to be executed remotely on the cluster:

```clojure
(task do-work)
```

done.

`task` here is a chazel's built-in function, and `do-work` is your function.

A couple of gotchas:

* `do-work` must exist on both: sending and "doing the work" JVMs
* in case you'd like to pass a function with arguments use `partial`

```clojure
(task (partial do-work arg1 arg2 ..))
```

### Sending Runnables

In example above `do-work` gets wrapped into a Runnable internal chazel [Task](https://github.com/tolitius/chazel/blob/6bfd0275239ea96a9240efb7abed6adaafd8ee6d/src/chazel/chazel.clj#L194)
and gets send to the cluster to execute.

Say the function we are sending is:

```clojure
(defn do-work [& args]
  (println "printing remotely..." args)
  (str "doing work remotely with args: " args))
```

If we send it with `(task do-work)`, you'll see `printing remotely... nil` in logs of a cluster member that picked up this task.
But you won't see `doing the work...` since it was silently executed on that member.

### Sending Callables

In case you do want to know when the task is done, or you'd like to own the result of the tasks, you can send a task that will return you a future back.
chazel calls this kind of task an `ftask`:

```clojure
chazel=> (ftask do-work)
#<ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture com.hazelcast.client.util.ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture@6148ce19>
```

In case of `ftask` chazel also wraps a function `do-work` into  [Task](https://github.com/tolitius/chazel/blob/6bfd0275239ea96a9240efb7abed6adaafd8ee6d/src/chazel/chazel.clj#L194), but now it cares of Task's Callable skills, hence we get a tasty future back. Let's deref it:

```clojure
chazel=> @(ftask do-work)
"doing work remotely with args: "
```

and send it some args:

```clojure
chazel=> @(ftask (partial do-work 42 "forty two"))
"doing work remotely with args: (42 \"forty two\")"
```

### Task Knobs

#### Send to All

A task that is sent with `task` of `ftask` by default will be picked up by any one member to run it.
Sometimes it is needed to send a task to be executed on all of the cluster members:

```clojure
chazel=> (ftask (partial do-work 42 "forty two") :members :all)
{#<MemberImpl Member [192.168.1.4]:5702> #<ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture com.hazelcast.client.util.ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture@2ae5cde4>,
 #<MemberImpl Member [192.168.1.4]:5701> #<ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture com.hazelcast.client.util.ClientCancellableDelegatingFuture@7db6db4>}
```

here we have a small local two node cluster, and what comes back is a {member future} map. Let's get all the results:

```clojure
chazel=> (def work (ftask (partial do-work 42 "forty two") :members :all))
#'chazel/work

chazel=> (into {} (for [[m f] work] [m @f]))
{#<MemberImpl Member [192.168.1.4]:5702>
 "doing work remotely with args: (42 \"forty two\")",
 #<MemberImpl Member [192.168.1.4]:5701>
 "doing work remotely with args: (42 \"forty two\")"}
```

#### Instance

By default chazel will look for a client instance, if it is active, it will use that, if not it will get a server instance instead.
But in case you'd like to use a concrete instance in order to send out tasks from you can:

```clojure
(task do-work :instance your-instance)
```

#### Executor Service

By default chazel will use a `"default"` executor service to submit all the tasks to.
But in case you'd like to pick a different one, you can:

```clojure
(task do-work :exec-svc-name "my-es")
```

#### All Together

All the options can be used with `task` and `ftask`:

```clojure
(task do-work :instance "my instance" :exec-svc-name "my-es")
```

```clojure
(ftask do-work :instance "my instance" :members :all :exec-svc-name "my-es")
```

## Distributed Reliable Topic

Hazelcast's Reliable Topic is backed by a [Ringbuffer](http://blog.hazelcast.com/ringbuffer-data-structure/) which amongst other benefits (i.e. not destructive operations, ttl, batching, etc.) sequences all the messages, which allows for an interesting replay use cases.

Since this is Hazelcast, we are dealing with a cluster of nodes, and depending on `backup-count` (a.k.a. quorum) this reliable topic is well _distributed_, which means it allows for better locality as well as higher availability: i.e. cluster may lose nodes, but all the topic messages will be still there to consume.

### Processing Payments

Let's say we have a system that publishes payments. We can send these payments to a reliable topic, and have some consumers that would be responsible to process these payments. So let's create this reliable topic:

```clojure
chazel=> (def payments (hz-reliable-topic :payments))
#'chazel/payments
```

and a simple functions that would process a single payment:

```clojure
chazel=> (defn process-payment [p] (info "processing payment" p))
#'chazel/process-payment
```

We can now add this function as one of the topic listeners by calling `add-message-listener` on the topic:

```clojure
chazel=> (add-message-listener payments process-payment)
"f3216455-f9c8-46ef-976a-cae942b15a8d"
```

This listener UUID can later be used to `remove-message-listener`.

Now let's publish some payments:

```clojure
chazel=> (publish payments {:name "John" :amount 4200.42M})

INFO: processing payment {:name John, :amount 4200.42M}

chazel=> (publish payments {:name "Kevin" :amount 2800.28M})

INFO: processing payment {:name Kevin, :amount 2800.28M}

chazel=> (publish payments {:name "Jessica" :amount 3400.34M})

INFO: processing payment {:name Jessica, :amount 3400.34M}
```

You can see that each payment is picked up by the listener and processed.

### Replaying Events

So far so good, but not much different from a regular pub/sub topic. Let's make it more interesting.

Say we have some problems with payments and we need to audit every payment that was sent. With a regular topic it would be hard to do (if at all possible) since we need to audit _all_ the payments: from the past and ongoing. With Hazelcast's Reliable Topic is not an issue, since it is backed by a Ringbuffer and all the messages are sequenced, we can just ask to replay the messages from an arbitrary sequence number.

First let's create a function that will do the audit work:

```clojure
chazel=> (defn audit-payment [p] (info "auditing payment" p))
#'chazel/audit-payment
```

and add it as a _reliable_ listener:

```clojure
chazel=> (add-reliable-listener payments audit-payment {:start-from 0})
"d274fab1-7f0f-47f9-a53a-58b35a4c68d1"

INFO: auditing payment {:name John, :amount 4200.42M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Kevin, :amount 2800.28M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Jessica, :amount 3400.34M}
```

Interesting, you see what happened? All the payments starting from the sequence `0` (the very beginning) were simply replayed and audited: niice!

Let's publish more payments:

```clojure
chazel=> (publish payments {:name "Rudolf" :amount 1234.56M})

INFO: auditing payment {:name Rudolf, :amount 1234.56M}
INFO: processing payment {:name Rudolf, :amount 1234.56M}

chazel=> (publish payments {:name "Nancy" :amount 6543.21M})

INFO: auditing payment {:name Nancy, :amount 6543.21M}
INFO: processing payment {:name Nancy, :amount 6543.21M}
```

Now _every_ ongoing payment gets processed _and_ audited, since there are two listeners attached to a topic.

Let's replay them all again, just for fun:

```clojure
chazel=> (add-reliable-listener payments audit-payment {:start-from 0})
"e2bd4912-7ccb-48b7-8102-b31e5660f68d"

INFO: auditing payment {:name John, :amount 4200.42M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Kevin, :amount 2800.28M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Jessica, :amount 3400.34M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Rudolf, :amount 1234.56M}
INFO: auditing payment {:name Nancy, :amount 6543.21M}
```

niice!

_there are other options that can be provided to a reliable listener: i.e. `start-from` `store-seq` `loss-tolerant?` `terminal?` if needed_

## Map Event Listeners

Hazelcast has map entry listeners which can be attached to maps and listen on different operations, namely:

* entry added
* entry updated
* entry removed
* entry evicted

chazel has all 4 listeners available as wrapper functions and ready to roll:

* entry-added-listener
* entry-updated-listener
* entry-removed-listener
* entry-evicted-listener

A chazel map entry listener would take a function and apply it every time the event takes place:

```clojure
chazel=> (def m (hz-map "appl"))
#'chazel/m

chazel=> (put! m 42 1)

chazel=> m
{42 1}
```

nothing fancy, usual map business. now let's add an update listener:

```clojure
chazel=> (def ul (entry-updated-listener (fn [k v ov] (println "updated: " {:k k :v v :ov ov}))))
#'chazel/ul
chazel=> (def id (add-entry-listener m ul))
#'chazel/id
chazel=> id
"927b9530-630c-4bbb-995f-9c74815d9ca9"
chazel=>
```

`ov` here is an `old value` that is being updated.

When the listener is added, hazelcast assigns a `uuid` to it. We'll use it a bit later. For now let's see how the listener works:

```clojure
chazel=> (put! m 42 2)
1
updated:  {:k 42, :v 2, :ov 1}
chazel=>

chazel=> (put! m 42 3)
updated:  {:k 42, :v 3, :ov 2}
2
```

now every time an entry gets updated a function we created above gets applied.

Since we have listener id, we can use it to remove this listener from the map:

```clojure
chazel=> (remove-entry-listener m id)
true

chazel=> (put! m 42 4)
3
chazel=> m
{42 4}
```

all back to vanilla, no listeners involved, map business.

## Serialization

Serialization is a big deal when hazelcast nodes are distributed, or when you connect to a remote hazelcast cluster. 
chazel solves this problem by delegating it to an optional serializer.

To start off, chazel has a [transit](https://github.com/cognitect/transit-clj) seriailzer ready to go:

```clojure
user=> (require '[chazel.serializer :refer [transit-in transit-out]])
user=> (def m (hz-map "amzn"))

user=> (put! m "bids" {:opening [429 431 430 429] :nbbo [428 430 429 427]} transit-out)
#<byte[] [B@5d9d8664>
user=>
```
notice `transit-out`, it is an optional function to `put!` that will be applied to the value before the hazelcast `.put` is called. In this case a value will be serialized with transit.

```clojure
user=> (cget m "bids")
#<byte[] [B@638b6eec>
```

a default chazel's `cget` will return the value the way hazelcast has it stored: as a byte array. Similarly to `put!`, `cget` also takes in an optional function that is applied after the value is fetched from hazelcast:

```clojure
user=> (cget m "bids" transit-in)
{:opening [429 431 430 429], :nbbo [428 430 429 427]}

user=> (type (cget m "bids" transit-in))
clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap
```

In case you need to use a different serializer, you can either send a pull request updating [chazel.serializer](https://github.com/tolitius/chazel/blob/master/src/chazel/serializer.clj), or by specifying your own "secret" serialize function in `put!` and `cget`.
